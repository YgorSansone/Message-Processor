# Message Reprocessor
This is a JavaScript script that automates the process of resending and updating the delivery status of messages in a messaging application. It works by selecting all the messages in the chat, marking them as delivered, waiting for a certain time, and then reloading the page to refresh the messages and repeat the process.

## How to Run
- Open the messaging application in your web browser.
- Open the developer console by pressing F12 or by right-clicking on the page and selecting Inspect.
- Go to the Console tab in the developer console.
- Copy and paste the code from the message-reprocessor.js file into the console and press Enter.
- The script will start running automatically and will repeat the process for a certain number of times,waiting for the page to reload and the messages to update between each iteration.# Message-Processor
